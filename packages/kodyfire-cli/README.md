*Kody is a command-line tool for generating artifact files, powered by both classic and AI code generation techniques. It can be used by both technical and non-technical users to generate files across a wide range of technologies.*

The code generation feature in Kody relies on [OpenAI GPT](https://openai.com/), a language model that uses deep learning to generate human-like text, and ChatGPT to provide natural language processing capabilities.

Getting Started
----------------


Open the project you are willing to work on using vscode or your prefered editor.
### Generate artifacts using AI
In case you want to exclusivly rely on AI to generate your artifacts. I don't need to install any additional kodies. Run the `kody ai [prompt]` command and follow the prompts.

```sh
kody ai create a Laravel Controller named SampleController under API/V1. Add a comment on top saying Hello Kodyfire!
```
You can use the experimental speech to text (STT) option to pass your prompt using your voice.
```sh
kody ai create a Laravel Controller named SampleController under API/V1. Add a comment on top saying Hello Kodyfire! -r
```
The transcription relies on [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) and requires [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) installed and available in your \$PATH. for the audio recording.
### For Linux

```
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all
```

### For MacOS

```
brew install sox
```

### For Windows

[Download the binaries](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/files/latest/download)
### Generate your artifact using the classical method

#### Search and install a kody

Based on your project, search [availables kodies](#Available%20kodies) and select the one that fits your need..

To search [availables kodies](#Available%20kodies) by keyword runthe following command. if you don't specify a keyword all available kodies will be listed.

```bash
kody search [keyword]
```

Install your kody of choice. For example, if you want to install the react kody

```bash
kody install react
```

or

```bash
npm install -s react-kodyfire
```

Please note you can install as many kodies in the same project as you wish.

#### Generate your artifact

There are 2 methods you can generate your artifacts with:

- The `generate` command
- The `run` command

##### Method 1: Generator mode `kody generate`

The recommended way of using kody is using the `generate` command. The command will assist you creating your artifact based on the chosen `concept`. For example, a react `component` is considered a `concept`.
In order to generate your artifacts, run the `generate` command. The syntax is `kody g|generate [kody] [concept]`. the assistant will prompt you to select the missing arguments. As an example, run the following command from your terminal:

```sh
kody generate react component
```

##### Method 2: Runner mode `kody run`

The `run` command is similar to the `generate` command. The `run` requires a definition file which is simply a json file containing all the concept definitions you have created using the `ride` command. The `generate` command on the other hand creates one or more concept definition on the run and process them on one run. Every command has its use cases.

###### Initialize kody

In order to start using kody, you need to initialize your project.

```bash
kody init
```

This will add the definition files required for kody runs.
<u>**Important**</u>: Please run the command **only once**. The command will override existing definition files. We will disable overriding in a future version.

###### Ride your kody

In order to update your definition, use the kody ride command to assist you populate the required fields

```bash
kody ride
```

###### Launch a kody run

Once you are satisified with your definition file, execute the run command to generate your artifacts.

```bash
kody run -s laravel-kody.json
```

To run all kodies defined within your project, run the following command:

```bash
kody batch
```
### Create your own kody

In most cases you might need a custom kody to suit your needs

#### Scaffold a new kody

Create a basic kody using the scaffold command. Follow the prompts to setup your kody

```bash
kody scaffold
```

This will create a folder containing the basic structure for a kody. You can start using right away within your project.

#### Setup your kody

##### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

##### Build your kody

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Add your concepts and related templates

//TODO
This will build your kody and export the basic templates files.

##### Add your kody as an NPM dependency to a test project

In order to be able to use it within your test project run the following command

```bash
npm i -s ./yourkody-kodyfire
```

### Publish your kody

Please remember that Kody is still in exploration phase and things will change frequently. Contribution is always highly requested.

#### Prepare your kody

Add the required kodyfire metadata to your package.json

```jsonc
{
  // A command for handling this part will be added in a future version
  "kodyfire": {
    "id": "your-id", // must be unique.
    "type": "kodyfire", // Example of valid technology names: laravel, express, react, angular, flutter, html, css. Default: kodyfire
    "version": "0.0.1"
  }
}
```

#### Publish to Github

Intialize your project as a git repository and push to a public Github repo

To do so, kindly follow these steps:-

1. Intitialize a new Github repository and make it public.
2. Open your project root folder locally from terminal and run the following commands:-

```bash
git init
```

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Initial Commit!"
```

3. Link your project to your Github repository.

```bash
git remote add origin <copied URL>
```

```bash
git push origin main
```

#### Publish to npm

Once you are satisfied with your kody and you would to like to share it with the community. Run the following command.

```bash
npm Publish
```

<u>Note</u>: <i>You'll need an NPM account</i>

#### Share with community

Congratulation publishing your first kody. Don't forget to share your kody repo link by opening an issue on Kody's github repository.

Terminology
-----------

*   **Kody**: Refers to the code generation command-line tool that generates digital artifacts.
*   **Artifacts**: Refers to the various digital products generated by Kody based on the input provided.

**Note:** Kody uses classical code generation techniques in addition to AI-powered code generation using OpenAI Codex and ChatGPT.
